# Simple Approach: 
To find the floor of the square root, try with all-natural numbers starting from 1. 
Continue incrementing the number until the square of that number is greater than the given number.
# Complexity Analysis:
Complexity Analysis:
# Time Complexity: O(√ n).
Only one traversal of the solution is needed, so the time complexity is O(√ n).
# Space Complexity: O(1).
Constant extra space is needed.
